1) Abstract:

- [x] This goes in Part A and there is no need to repeat it in Part B so, don’t forget to remove it from Part B, else it’ll eat on your 45-page limit.

- [x] IMO it lacks “punch”, in the sense that it doesn’t provide a clear justification for the work, nor says much in terms of impact (eg, “scale”, match with expected outcomes…). It mostly talks about what the project would do, as technical/research work, but doesn’t say much about most of the whys. Why should the EC fund your project, and fund it now – ie, why is reproducibility with existing tools an important issue that must be fixed now to achieve the expected outcomes and Destination impacts? Here you could reuse some of the things you say eg in 1.1.4 Motivation.

- [x] Also, I’m not sure it clearly says what is the problem you are trying to solve (it talks about the work to be done, which is not quite the same). Also, make clear that the scope of the work goes beyond Jupyter.

- [x] You should make it clear here that this is about *computational* reproducibility. You say so in the 2st par of 1.1.1 Ambition, but it bears repeating here. Remember that that the abstract is used to select reviewers, and that the call topic is about reproducibility in general, not just about computational tools.


2) Objectives:

- [ ] I think you should start sec. 1.1 with the objectives (as indicated in the template), then move into the SotA and ambition (yes, I know this can make for somewhat odd reading, but this is what is expected.)

- [ ] Your objectives must be SMART but I don’t see much about this? (how would you measure them, are they achievable, etc.)

- [ ] Maybe better to put them in tabular form, separating some of the detail from the core description of each objective? Eg, for obj. 1, the first sentence is the “objective” as such, the rest is an explanation / further details. In the same table you can add the SMART aspects, eg in another column. If table 1.1.1 is about WP tasks, then it is out of place here.

- [ ] Don’t forget you need to match your objectives to the scope items in the topic. You can do this in a separate table from the one I mentioned above, if putting everything together in the same table makes it too crowded.


3) 1.1.7 Impact:

- [ ] I think most of this text seems more suitable instead for sec. 2 Impact; in particular, for talking about the “scale” in 2.1(b).

- [ ] Parts of this text should / could instead be reframed as Ambition; eg, bring Binder tools to a user base wider than Jupyter’s (2nd par).


4) 1.1.6 Excellence: similarly, this seems more suitable as material for 3.2 Consortium as a whole?


5) Maybe 1.1.4 Motivation could be (partly) merged with the SotA, so that, when describing how the project goes beyond the SotA, it is clear what are the technical issues with the SotA. By the way, if I read the SotA it sounds as if everything is mostly OK as it is now, except for training / experience; why then a need for this project?


6) TRLs: are there individual pieces of the work that would be brought to (or start from) different TRLs, or is all the technology moving "as a block” to TRL 8? If the former, then better to provide the different start & end TRLs for those pieces. Isn’t there some tech that would start at TRL < 6? (6 is already very high as a starting point for a RIA).


7) 1.2 Methodology:

- [ ] Make explicit back references to the project objectives.

- [ ] Maybe the subsection 1.2.10 could be moved at the very beginning of 1.2, then the rest of 1.2 provides all the explanations and details? Barring a mention or two to terms that are introduced later, this part can be read & understood before having gone into any details. Just an idea.


8) 1.2.7 Terminology:

- [ ] Can this be called “Concepts” instead (or something similar)?

- [ ] Formatting / presentation suggestion: turn all this subsection into eg a side box, to be inserted earlier in 1.2 since you refer to these terms across the whole of 1.2.


9) “Training” is referred to in several parts of 1.2 (eg, 1.2.10 or 1.2.5), but it is not clear what this is exactly or how will it be done, at least not from what is presented in 1.2.


10) 2.1.2 Barriers: do not mix or confuse barriers and requirements here — which are about risks of the project not delivering on its planned impacts — with project management and implementation risks.


11) Impacts table:

- [ ] I don’t see the items in the first column under “Expected impacts” of the topic’s Destination, nor under “expected outcomes” of the topic?! Remember you need to explicitly match these with what the project aims to do wrt “impact”.

- [ ] When presenting these things, better to separate outcomes (short term) and impacts (medium/long term).

- [ ] The template asks for a narrative format; better not to use a table. After all, there is already a table for all this, that’s section 2.3.

- [ ] “Scale" and “significance” are mostly missing. I note that there is some text related to scale in sec. 1, maybe you can build on that.

- [ ] Hard numbers for KPIs are missing. Provide them if / where possible. (Yes, I know it can be very hard, but what is expected is for you to say things like “we target an X% increase in the number of users of Y”).


12) I don’t see any exploitation plans. For academics it would be relatively easy (?) to write something, but there is one industry partner. How do they plan to exploit the results? (especially since this all open source). Don’t neglect this.
