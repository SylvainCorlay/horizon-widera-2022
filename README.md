## Prior proposal: BOSSEE

This proposal is adapted from a prior submission, BOSSEE.

BOSSEE is a [proposal](submitted.pdf) that was submitted on January
29th to the H2020 European E-Infrastructure call
[INFRAEOSC-02-2019](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/infraeosc-02-2019).

Its mission is to promote Open Science (Open Source, Open
Publications, Open Data, and
[Open Proposal](https://opendreamkit.org/2015/01/31/open-proposal-writing/))
by supporting the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem, deploying generic
Jupyter based services (binder federation and more), integrating them
tightly in the
[European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eosc-hub.eu/),
and demonstrating their value through applications in astronomy,
education, fluid dynamics, geosciences, health sciences, mathematics,
and photon science.

The project was seeded as a follow-up to
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org) (see the
[brainstorm notes](https://hackmd.io/fNJQFqgYQaCDGx-BFgz4XQ)),
and grown organically in the same open spirit.
The proposers include core Jupyter developers (lead: Benjamin
Ragan-Kelley) and long time Jupyter activists from many disciplines,
in France, Germany, Poland, Norway, and Switzerland.

## Positions

If accepted (notifications around June) the project will start around
September 2019, and will open about 11 postdoc or research software
engineer positions in our various institutions.
