In the preparation of this project, we have already secured agreement from the
following to be part of the panel:
\begin{itemize}
\item Rollin Thomas, Big Data Architect at HPC expert at the National Energy
  Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  (US). He represents the HPC community, and focuses on interactivity,
  real-time, and reproducibility in supercomputing for science.
\item Andreas Zeller, Professor of Software Engineering. He uses Notebooks 
  to provide open-source text books to his students and the world-wide
  community of readers. He will represent Binder users in academia, who use it 
  to deliver zero-install computational environments for educational
  purposes.
