In the preparation of this project, we have already secured agreement from the
following to be part of the panel:
\begin{itemize}
\item Paula Andrea Martinez, project Coordinator - Software Program, \href{https://ardc.edu.au/}{Australian Research Data Commons} (ARDC).
She is also the co-chair of the \href{https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-research-software-fair4rs-wg}{FAIR4RS RDA Working Group} and
Community Manager  at \href{https://www.researchsoft.org/}{Research Software Alliance} (ReSA), and actively contributing
to increase the visibility of research software.
\item Aleksandra Nenadic, Training Lead of the Software Sustainability Institute, 
based at the University of Manchester (UK). She is also an active member and 
promoter of the Carpentries community and involved as an instructor, 
instructor trainer, mentor, workshop organiser and regional coordinator

  (EGI-ACE) and the EOSC Compute Platform, which are working on a large-scale
  deployment of BinderHub as part of their services for researchers in Europe
  and beyond.
\item Rollin Thomas, Big Data Architect at HPC expert at the National Energy
  Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  (US). He represents the HPC community, and focuses on interactivity,
  real-time, and reproducibility in supercomputing for science.
\item Andreas Zeller, Professor of Software Engineering. He uses Notebooks 
  to provide open-source text books to his students and the world-wide
  community of readers. He will represent Binder users in academia, who use it 
  to deliver zero-install computational environments for educational
  purposes.
