  Clearer problem statement: shift emphasis from work description to problem/impact

  Note from review:
doesn't provide a clear justification for the work, nor says much in terms of impact (eg, `scale', match with expected outcomes...). It mostly talks about what the project would do, as technical/research work, but doesn't say much about most of the whys. Why should the EC fund your project, and fund it now – ie, why is reproducibility with existing tools an important issue that must be fixed now to achieve the expected outcomes and Destination impacts? Here you could reuse some of the things you say eg in 1.1.4 Motivation.

- Also, I’m not sure it clearly says what is the problem you are trying to solve (it talks about the work to be done, which is not quite the same). Also, make clear that the scope of the work goes beyond Jupyter.

- You should make it clear here that this is about *computational* reproducibility. You say so in the 2st par of 1.1.1 Ambition, but it bears repeating here. Remember that that the abstract is used to select reviewers, and that the call topic is about reproducibility in general, not just about computational tools.

\TODO{Is it appropriate to mention who we are in the abstract? Or spend these words on something else, such as training/best practices?

\TODO{ANS: Yes, if we have the words, but lower priority than hitting all outcomes
