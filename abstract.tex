% (a3) prompt: Services supporting scholarly communication and open access (4M): based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.), the services should empower researchers and research communities and initiatives with the necessary tools and functionalities for systematic publishing, analysing and re-using of scientific results beyond publications (data, software and other artefacts), as well as supporting long-term preservation and curation. The services should also enable scientific workflows with adequate metrics and monitoring mechanisms supporting career development and the monitoring of funding and research impact. Support to a catch-all repository for open research should be provided.

%  To truly achieve the societal goals of Open Science,
%  we must make progress beyond the `mere availability' of scientific results,
%  to the practical usability and exploitation of such data once it is made available,
%  an area where there is much room for improvement.
%  The Jupyter project and its ecosystem show great promise
%  as tools for bridging this gap; for making Open Science
%  useful and accessible to all,
%  from researchers to educators to public citizens.
%  The Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter ecosystem are of increasing
%  importance in computational science, data science, academia,
%  industry, governments, and service providers,
%  used by millions worldwide.
%  Jupyter notebooks have great potential to push Open Science
%  forward because they provide a complete description of a
%  computational study that can be turned into a publication
%  or produce part of a publication, such as a figure,
%  making complex tasks reproducible.
%  The Jupyter-based Binder project adds a means to execute notebooks
%  in specified computational environments, an aspect of reproducibility
%  not yet widely supported.
%  In \TheProject, we will extend the capabilities of the Jupyter
%  tools and ecosystem to add functionality that we view as having great
%  importance for EOSC and Open Science more
%  widely and operate services on EOSC as a demonstration.
%
%  Many \TheProject partners have longstanding experience and
%  leadership roles in the Jupyter ecosystem,
%  and in deploying services built on Jupyter to many users across the globe.
%  Complementary to this core expertise,

To truly achieve the societal goals of Open Science,
we must make progress beyond the `mere availability' of scientific results as Open Access,
to the practical usability and exploitation of such artefacts once they are made available,
an area where there is much room for improvement.
The Jupyter ecosystem shows great promise as a collection of tools for bridging this gap;
for making Open Science useful and accessible to all,
empowering researchers, educators, and public citizens.
Jupyter is of increasing importance in computational science,
data science, academia, industry, governments, and service providers, and used by millions worldwide.
Jupyter notebooks have great potential to push Open Science beyond publications
because they encapsulate a computational study that may be part of a publication,
such as the creation of a figure,
a major part of making complex tasks reproducible.
The Jupyter-based Binder project adds a means to execute notebooks in specified computational environments,
an aspect of reproducibility not yet widely supported,
and of great falue to re-using scientific results.

Tools such as Jupyter and Binder increase the value of all existing Open Access initiatives
by adding the axis of interactive computability,
empowering researchers to produce derivative and validating (or refuting) work.
Services such as Binder also expose public metrics and monitoring,
supporting the monitoring of research impact and career development for any users of the system.

We will (i) extend the capabilities of the Jupyter tools and ecosystem
to add functionality that we view as essential to and providing great value for EOSC and Open Science,
focused on accessibility, interactive publications, and reproducibility.
Based on this framework of improved Jupyter tools,
it will be possible to build Open Science Publication of Research Environments (\TheProject),
and (ii) build a range of diverse innovative open services on EOSC as
part of this project,
both to demonstrate and ensure that our developments serve real-world Open Science use cases.

Many \TheProject partners have longstanding experience and leadership roles in the Jupyter ecosystem,
and in deploying services built on Jupyter to many users across the globe.
Complementary to this core expertise,
we integrate partners focusing on the application of these tools to a wide range of scientific disciplines and communities,
for which EOSC-hosted demonstrator services are developed.
