% % (a3) prompt: Services supporting scholarly communication and open access (4M): based on existing initiatives across Europe (institutional and thematic repositories, aggregators, etc.), the services should empower researchers and research communities and initiatives with the necessary tools and functionalities for systematic publishing, analysing and re-using of scientific results beyond publications (data, software and other artefacts), as well as supporting long-term preservation and curation. The services should also enable scientific workflows with adequate metrics and monitoring mechanisms supporting career development and the monitoring of funding and research impact. Support to a catch-all repository for open research should be provided.

  \TODO{Comment on Binder being a generic tool -- not limited to Jupyter}

  \TODO{Comment on Best practice guidelines and Training we deliver}
  
To increase the reproducibility of scientific results, we need find technical
solutions that enable reproducibility, and which at the same time are practical
and acceptable to the researchers who (could) use them.

The Jupyter notebook and ecosystem offers high potential for reproducibility:
(i) it is used widely, (ii) the notebook is a document that includes the
computation, and (iii) the notebook is machine executable.

Reproducibility enabled through Jupyter notebooks can have high impact due to
the wide spread use of notebooks: the notebook provides an environment for
scientific data exploration and thinking that is embraced and adopted by many.

To be able to reproduce results from notebooks, the software environment in
which the notebook should be executed needs to be created. This project is
about automating and improving ways to do this by improving and extending the
Binder project.

The Binder project automates the creation of software environments in which
notebooks can be executed, based on software specification standards that
already exist.

In this project, we will (i) investigate which fraction of existing Jupyter
notebooks are reproducible. Such reproducibility either comes from the efforts
of pioneers in the field to make their repositories 'Binder-enabled' using the
already existing Binder software. Or the reproducibility of the software environment is
provided because the authors of the notebook deposited software specifications
in a standard way with the notebook, which the binder tool correctly interprets.

We will (ii) extend the robustness of the applicability of the
Binder tools. For example, authors may not specify which version of
software they have used. Using the commit dates in the repository, an
improved Binder can attempt to identify a working version. We will
(iii) extend Binder's capabilities to broaden the applicability and
increase the positive impact on reproducibility in science. 

We will evaluate our efforts with selected and new use cases, such as
data publishing and use of Binder in HPC contexts, and invite the
community of researchers to contribute to the project. 

Many \TheProject individuals have longstanding experience and leadership roles in the
development of the Jupyter ecosystem, and in deploying services built on
Jupyter to many users across the globe. Complementary to this core expertise, we
integrate partners focusing on the application of these tools to a range of
scientific disciplines and communities.

All outcomes from this project -- including improved and new software, best
practice guides, application examples and training materials -- will be made
available as open source.
