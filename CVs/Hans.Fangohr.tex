  \medskip Hans Fangohr is an academic at the University
  of Southampton in the United Kingdom since 2002 (full professor
  since 2010), and leading the data analysis services at European XFEL
  in Germany since 2017.


  He has been a long term proponent of Open Science, and in particular
  involved with the the use and further development of the Jupyter
  Notebook to enable this. He has hosted Thomas Kluyver at the
  University of Southampton since 2015 from where he contributed as a
  core developer of the Jupyter team. As a PI in the EC-funded e-INFRA
  OpenDreamKit project (2015-2019), he has pushed forward the use of
  Jupyter Notebooks for reproducible computational science, and
  started the notebook validation tool (NBVAL). He made use of the
  Jupyter Ecosystem for research and education at graduate and
  postgraduate level at the University of Southampton, and shared
  resources widely, including a text book provided through Jupyter
  Notebooks, which can be executed interactively online [1].

  Since 2017, he is designing data analysis services and
  infrastructure at the European XFEL research facility. European XFEL
  is using IPython and the Jupyter Notebook as core utilities in their
  large scale experiment control, data capture and data
  analysis. Within the e-INFRA project PaNOSC (Photon and Neutron
  Science Open Cloud, 2018-2021, \cite{panosc}), he is leader of the
  Work Package~4, which is focused on data analysis services for the
  EOSC Hub, and the use of the Jupyter notebook with its existing
  features on the EOSC hub.

  In this project (\TheProject), where new capabilities for the Jupyter
  notebook and ecosystem are being designed, Hans' wide experience and
  interaction with different science groups will be beneficial to
  ensure the outcome is of value to open science in many domains. This
  includes him chairing the interdisciplinary computational modelling
  group at the University of Southampton (200 academics, 2008-2017),
  chairing the national EPSRC scientific advisory committee on High
  Performance Computing in the UK (2014-2017) and interacting with a
  large variety of science users at European XFEL in his role
  to lead the data analysis service provision.
