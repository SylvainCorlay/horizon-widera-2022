\TOWRITE{repurposed task from BOSSEE}

This Work package is focused on making \repotodocker{} do the things it does
already \emph{better}, \emph{more robustly} and \emph{more sustainably}.
(Orthogonal to those improvements, we plan to significantly extend the use cases
for \repotodocker{} in \WPref{impact}.)

To be able to asses the impact of our planned improvements, we need to have a
metric. Task \localtaskref{repo2docker-checker} will create this
for us. In addition to the evaluation of the improvements in this proposal, this
can be used more generally as an indicator for reproducibility of software
environments.

One major improvement to the existing capabilities of \repotodocker is the
\emph{time-machine} functionality, and this is implemented in \localtaskref{repo2docker-timemachine}.


Open source software needs ongoing maintenance to adapt to changing requirements
and dependencies. We schedule a certain amount of time for this in task \localtaskref{maintenance}.

% the existing functionality of repodocker.
% Community-led open source software is critical to a sustainable future for open science.
% Commonly used tools make up a shared infrastructure,
% where investment in core components benefits the widest user community.
% \TheProject is centred around the Jupyter project,
% which is a collection of projects for interactive computing and
% communicating computational ideas.
% 
% This work package is focused on developing and maintaining
% the core of Jupyter.
% In particular, we will help maintain these projects to meet the needs of the
% Jupyter community, with a focus on needs for open science.
% To serve the needs of \TheProject,
% Jupyter core infrastructure will need improvements
% to security, performance, and scalability,
% which will be provided in \localtaskref{maintenance}.
% In addition, we will develop new features in the core of Jupyter
% to bring it to a wider audience,
% and to improve its usefulness to those working toward open science practices,
% including via collaboration features (\localtaskref{collaboration})
% and accessibility (\localtaskref{accessibility}).
