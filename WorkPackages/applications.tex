\begin{wpobjectives}
  The objectives of this work package are
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item to guide the development of core tools by simultaneously
     developing and using applications in diverse fields with active
     scientists from these fields, and
   \item to demonstrate that the tools we develop are valuable to diverse
     fields of science, thus ensuring we develop e-infrastructure and
     services which can cater for a broad European and global research community
   \end{compactitem}
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}

  Whilst the components issued from work packages  \WPref{reproducibility} and \WPref{impact} will be
  made available as generic building blocks for reproducible open science services,
  this work package aims at specific real-world cases.

  We have selected a number of applications in a variety of domains
  to demonstrate the broad impact of \TheProject, in particular in the
  areas of \TOWRITE{tasks}
  % (\localtaskref{astro}), education
  % (\localtaskref{teaching}), fluid dynamics
  % (\localtaskref{application-gpu}), geosciences
  % (\localtaskref{geoscience}), health
  % (\localtaskref{opendose-analysis}), mathematics
  % (\localtaskref{math}) and photon science and imaging
  % (\localtaskref{reproducibility-xfel}).
  The context and vision for each of the demonstrators is described in
  section \ref{sec:science-demonstrators-in-concept} on page
  \pageref{sec:science-demonstrators-in-concept}.

  Working closely with the core developers of the Jupyter ecosystem will make it possible to
  go way beyond what is normally available "out-of-the-box" and to offer better solutions,
  thereby guiding further development of the core features.

  \medskip

  All demonstrators will validate the Jupyter service capabilities such as reproducibility,
  interactive widget use and visualisation, and show how these can
  enable new open science on EOSC.

  The particular workflows, data infrastructures and data policies for
  FAIR\footnote{Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable} sharing of data vary from one community and use-case to
  the other, or may not be fully defined yet. Therefore, this proposal
  does not enforce a specific way of handling data. Instead we
  will explore in the demonstrator tasks how existing data policies,
  infrastructure and workflows can be respected and integrated with
  authentication and authorisation, data management, and
  JupyterHub/Binder services on EOSC. EGI is a partner
  for all the tasks in this work package and will work with us to find the
  best integration solutions in the evolving EOSC
  infrastructure.

  For some of the demonstrators, authentication and authorization and/or
  data management are being advanced outside \TheProject.
