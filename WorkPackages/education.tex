  The objective of this work package is to disseminate the results of this
  project, including the technical advances and guidance for best practice for
  reproducible science. This includes education of researchers about the value of
  open science, reproducibility and re-usability as well as the possibilities of
  integrating Binder tools in their workflows.

  Beyond this activity acting from the project members to the wider community of
  scientists, we also plan to seek input from scientists to the project: both in
  terms of requirements for practical reproducibility in their domain and in
  technical contributions -- for example through merge requests for Binder
  tools, or open source documentation of best practice for reprocudible software
  environments.

  This includes:
 \begin{compactitem}
   \item Ensure awareness of the results of the project in the user community,
     and in particular in those groups that act as educators and multipliers of
     knowldege (such as the Carpentries and research infrastructure organisations).
   \item Educate the community on the value of open science, and in particular
   \item Train researchers in best practices for open and reproducible science.
   \item Produce training and education material to disseminate the ability to
     do reproducible computational science using the tools we develop.
   % \item Define individual exploitation plans; ? XXX

\begin{wpdescription}

  Open science and reproducible science is entirely dependent on researchers
  adopting open practices. In \TheProject, we improve and developing tools that
  can facilitate these practices, but they only work if researchers actually adopt
  them. For researchers to adopt the practices, they need to (i) know about them
  and (ii) use them.

  We address challenge in multiple ways:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item the philosophy of the Binder tools is to respect existing standards and
      best practice (and not to invent additional syntax or requirements). It is
      thus possible to use the Binder tools (to recreate a software environment)
      even if the repository authors did not anticipate the use of Binder, or
      knew about their existence. In the best possible scenario, a
      \emph{scientist can use Binder with zero additional effort}.

    \item In this work package, we produce education materials and carry out
      education activities to spread the knowledge about \emph{good practice for
        reproducibility and re-usability in science}, such as for example
      automation of all analysis steps, and complete documentation of the
      required software stack. Only one aspect of this training is to show how
      Binder can help with reproducibility.
    
      Attendees and users following such training and advice will create more
      reproducible artifacts. If they - or later users of their published
      artifacts - want to use Binder to reproduce or re-use the results, they
      can. Even if they do not, we will have achieved an improvement of the
      reproducibility of scientific artifacts.
  \end{enumerate}

  % HF: I think training the wider (non-scientist) public about Binder is going
  % too far?
  % 
  % Going further, it is also clear that open science is not just of value
  % to researchers: one of the largest benefits of open science is that it makes
  % science accessible to the broader public who may not be members of the
  % research community.
  % 
  % To this end, in addition to training researchers, we will also train the
  % public in how to make use of the open science research and services
  % facilitated by \TheProject. This will be done through regular open
  % dissemination and training workshops, as well as by producing and maintaining
  % material for online courses and documentation.

\TheProject will develop, through \WPref{applications}, a number of demonstrator repositories that
show examples of reproducibility. We use those activities to inform and evaluate
the
technical improvement to the Binder tools in \WPref{reproducibility} and
\WPref{impact}. We also use those studies to create tutorials and \emph{best practice guides
  for reproducibility} in this work package.

We will also participate in the concertation activities, consultations and other
meetings and events of the European E-Infrastructure projects. \TODO{Do we still
want this sentence? If so, mention EGI here?}

As with all the code, test and build infrastructure produced as part of the
project, we will also make all documentation open source. Our documentation --
which includes best practice guides for reproducibility -- can thus be modified
and improved after the end of the project to react to new developments.

Open access to all publications resulting from the project will be ensured.
\TODO{Should this sentence go into a data / IPR management plan?}
