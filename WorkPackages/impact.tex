% Open source software in general, and Jupyter in particular,
% is developed not as a monolithic application,
% but rather as a collection of related components,
% which can be assembled in numerous combinations to meet diverse needs.
% The Jupyter community is no different.
% Jupyter itself is composed of several projects,
% but there are even more projects that build on top of Jupyter to create
% things like cloud services or data pipelines.
% The goal of \TheProject is to facilitate open science through Jupyter,
% and this includes working with projects all around the Jupyter ecosystem.
% We will focus this work package on developing
% Jupyter ecosystem projects with an emphasis on open science.
% 
% repo2docker is a project for creating
% reproducible environments in which Jupyter notebooks (and other user interfaces) can be run.
% It reads a number of common formats to list required software packages,
% and prepares a Docker container with those packages installed.
% BinderHub is software for operating a web service using repo2docker,
% which enables sharing of interactive and reproducible Jupyter (and Rstudio) environments on the web with a single link.
% We will develop repo2docker and BinderHub further to meet the needs of the open science community.
% 
% In addition to the interactive aspects of Jupyter,
% notebooks can be used in a "workflows" style,
% where job systems run analyses and produce reports,
% either on a scheduled basis or triggered by events.
% There is a great deal of interest in using notebooks in this way,
% and much room for development of tools supporting workflows in data-driven open science.
