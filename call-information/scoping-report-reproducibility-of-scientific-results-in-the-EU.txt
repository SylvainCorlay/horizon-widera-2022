Notes from the EU scoping report (https://github.com/minrk/horizon-widera-2022/blob/main/call-information/scoping-report-reproducibility-of-scientific-results-in-the-EU.pdf)

Recommendations from the report:
- page 6: Best practices in the reproducibility continuum start far before publication of
  scientific results to make them ‘reasonably available’.

- page 16: invest in training of young scientists
- page 16: align efforts on reproducibility with publishers and stake holders

- page 21: guidelines are good, should be concrete (check list rather than generic)

Vocabulary 
- page 4/5: A reproducibility continuum is based on three main research processes: 
  reproduction, replication, and re-use. All three processes rest on the
  availability of data and methods from the original study. 

  -> software environments and software special cases of data and methods
  -> workflow is described as 'protocols' - so should use that somewhere in the beginning

- transparency important (page 7)
  - open data / open science / open source generally helps but is not required
