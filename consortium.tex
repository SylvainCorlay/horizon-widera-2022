%remove this, as we have more pressing things left.

\eucommentary{
The individual members of the consortium are described in a
separate section under Part A. There is no need to repeat that
information here.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  Describe the consortium. How does it match the project's objectives,
  and bring together the necessary disciplinary and inter-disciplinary
  knowledge. Show how this includes expertise in social sciences and
  humanities, open science practices, and gender aspects of R\&I, as
  appropriate. Include in the description affiliated entities and
  associated partners, if any.
\item
  Show how the partners will have access to critical infrastructure
  needed to carry out the project activities.
\item
  Describe how the members complement one another (and cover the value
  chain, where appropriate)
\item
  In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that
  each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil
  that role.
\item
  If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the
  project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is
  consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which
  are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see
  section 2.2).
\item
  \textbf{Other countries and international organisations}: If one or
  more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country
  or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible
  for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from
  Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive
  list included in the Work Programme General Annexes B are
  automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation
  of the entity in question is essential to successfully carry out the
  project.

\subsubsection{Consortium composition}

The \TheProject consortium spans the broad spectrum of actors required for
successfully developing and dissemiating tools and infrastructure for open and
reproducible computational science, catering to the needs of the European and
global scientific community. It is composed of one academic institution
(University of Oslo), three research organisations (Max Planck Society, Ifremer,
Simula), and one SME (Quantstack) based in three different countries (Norway,
France, Germany).

The consortium has developed through collaborations and common interests. Some
partners have been working together on different aspects of Jupyter development
(\site{QS}, \site{SRL}), software for education (\site{QS}, \site{SRL},
\site{MP}) and use of Jupyter tools for reproducible science {\site{MP},
  \site{SRL}} for many years. Meanwhile, others joined together during a
previous successful H2020 European Research Infrastructure project OpenDreamKit
\#676541 (\site{MP}, \site{SRL}). Additionally, some partners have expertise in
the practice of open science and training (\site{IFR}, \site{UIO}).

Many participants (\site{MP}, \site{UiO}, \site{IFR}) have scientists involved who work on
facilitating computational and open science for scientists in their
institutions. As such, each of them has experience and a good overview of the
requirements for effective science and reproducible science from the many
research projects they are connected to. In addition, several of them are
research active in scientific domains, reproducibility and education.

Finally, we note that all project partners are long time passionate advocates of
Open and Reproducible Science; building on highly successful past experience
with OpenDreamKit, they \emph{have chosen to write this proposal fully in the
  open} on GitHub
(\href{https://github.com/minrk/horizon-widera-2022}{https://github.com/minrk/horizon-widera-2022})
for maximum transparency and engagement of the community. We have used the same
open source collaboration tools and practices as the Open Source Open Science
community.

\subsubsection{Complementarity and interdisciplinarity}

For the successful delivery of this project with its mission to enable better
reproducibility and science through better software (and services depending on
this), we need complementary expertise from researchers and research software
engineers. As we build on, improve and advance existing software tools from
Project Jupyter, it will be essential to know these well. As our approach will
provide automatic reproducible computational environments if best practice is
followed by the researchers, the education and training aspect for best practice
is also vital for this project.

The chosen consortium ensures a critical mass of scientific expertise and
excellence in key areas (such as natural sciences, education, software
engineering, Project Jupyter) with research organisations and SMEs of recognised
international reputation.

In more detail: 
\begin{compactitem}
\item A set of use cases that cover several application domains and users, and that impose very diverse
requirements on open tools (\site{MP}, \site{IFR}, \site{UIO});
\item Lead developers in the Jupyter Ecosystem, including IPython, the Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab,
JupyterHub, Binder, MyBinder.org, Jupyter Widgets (\site{SRL}, \site{QS})
\item Experts and major promoters of the Jupyter collaborative user interfaces
  for interactive, exploratory and reproducible computing in a variety of scientific domains (\site{MP}, \site{IFR}, \site{UIO});
\item A long experience and proven track record of success with large and complex collaborative projects,
including European E-Infrastructure projects (\site{MP}, \site{SRL}),
projects focused on large-scale infrastructures and large experimental services (\site{MP}, \site{IFR}),
as well as experience in running large scale open source projects (Jupyter project, \site{SRL}, \site{QS});
\item A comprehensive range of skill sets and competencies in several relevant domains,
from applied research to standardisation to business analysis.
