The \repotodocker{} tool searches a given repository for specifications of
software dependencies, and carries on to compose instructions to install all of
the software dependencies within a Docker container image. In this task, we
modularise this functionality, and make it possible to extract the required
instructions on their own (for example into a stand-alone shell script).

Such functionality could be used to:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item Extract the list of installation commands to carry out a local install of
    the required software, or an installation within any other environment.
  \item In particular on HPC systems, it may be necessary to install software
    directly on the host, and this functionality would simplify that.
  \item Having the installation instructions neatly summarised will also help to
    understand what software specifications are (explicitly or implicitly )
    given within the repository.
  \item Having the installation instructions extracted, these can be used to
    explore the effects of changing versions of a particular library or
    dependency. This will be helpful to track down the origins of observed
    non-reproducibility.
  \end{compactitem}

  This feature will become part of the \repotodocker{} functionality
  (\localdelivref{extract-dependencies}).

%   The task includes the following activities
%   \begin{compactitem}
%   \item ...
%      % deliverable will be defined in the appropriate WorkPackage.tex
%     % (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
%   \end{compactitem}
