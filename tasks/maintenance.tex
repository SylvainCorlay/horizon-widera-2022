\TOWRITE{Good idea to keep this. We need to rework the next paragraph, and agree
on a representation of the Binder / Jupyter relationship and connection.}

Developing software that people will use requires maintenance of that software,
not just new development. Millions of people rely on Jupyter software, including
all participants in \TheProject, and with this proposal, we will fund general
support of the Jupyter infrastructure.

Maintenance of core software is often an implicit and un-paid cost, or one
hidden in over-describing the resources required to deliver proposed
developments. In \TheProject, we make it clear and explicit that we will spend a
significant amount of time developing and maintaining the core Jupyter and
JupyterHub e-Infrastructure to respond to the needs of \TheProject and others,
and contribute towards the sustainability and health of the community.

We will provide support to the Jupyter e-Infrastructure software, ensuring that
it meets the needs (\localdelivref{jupyter-contributions}) of \TheProject, and
aid in the release process to ensure that stable releases of Jupyter software
can be used in mature \TheProject services (\localdelivref{jupyter-releases}).

  \TheProject will need improvements to core Jupyter functionality, including areas of:

  \begin{compactenum}
    \item ease of deployment
    \item security
    \item scalability of JupyterHub
    \item performance
  \end{compactenum}

  We will contribute improvements in these areas,
  meeting the needs of \TheProject and benefiting the wider Jupyter
  community.
