  In this task, we want to demonstrate the value and usefulness of \WPref{reproducibility} and
  \WPref{impact} with real scientific use cases from the research communities involved in \TheProject.
  The demonstrators are designed to exploit the solutions developed within \TheProject (Binder@Home, Binder@HPC, data publishing)
  and leverage existing institutional and/or national e-infrastructures as well as core EOSC services. 

  \begin{compactitem}
  \item FAIR Nordic Earth System Modelling: this science demonstrator leverages Binder@HOME (model development, education, single column or very simple model configuration), Binder@HPC (operational runs at scale including on EuroHPC), data publishing (publication of simulation results from blue-sky research);
     % deliverable will be defined in the appropriate WorkPackage.tex

  \end{compactitem}
