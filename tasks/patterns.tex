% template for a task
% each task should be added to exactly one workpackage
% in the workpackage task list
\begin{task}[
  title=Support more use patterns,
  % task id for references
  id=patterns,
  % lead institution ID
  lead=SRL,
  PM=1,
  wphases={0-36},
  % partner institution ID(s)

  partners={MP}
]

  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Data access (BinderHub deployment, possibly mostly docs)
