  There are two different aspects of software specification that \repotodocker{}
  needs to understand:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the specification of the software environment, for example through
    \softwarename{requirements.txt} files, etc (see Section
    \ref{repo2docker-supported-software-specifications} for a list of currently
    supported standards),
  \item from where to retrieve the software itself: this will be different on a
    Github repository or a Zenodo archive. \TODO{Add list of source locations
      that are supported. Add this close to \ref{repo2docker-supported-software-specifications}.}
  \end{enumerate}

  For both aspects, there are requests from potential Binder users to extend the
  capabilities of \repotodocker{}.

  In this task, we will prioritise such requests and extend the \repotodocker{}
  functionality to support as many new standards as possible.
