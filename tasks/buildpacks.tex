  There are two different aspects of software specification that \repotodocker{}
  needs to understand:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item the specification of the software environment, for example through
    \softwarename{requirements.txt} files, etc (see
    Section~\ref{sec:repo2docker}
    for more details on the currently
    supported standards),
  \item from where to retrieve the software itself: this will be different on a
    GitHub repository or a Zenodo archive
    (see also \ref{sec:repo2docker} for supported repositories).
  \end{compactitem}

  For both aspects, there are requests from potential Binder users to extend the
  capabilities of \repotodocker{}.

  In this task, we will prioritise such requests and extend the \repotodocker{}
  functionality to support as many new standards as possible to best meet community needs.

\end{task}
