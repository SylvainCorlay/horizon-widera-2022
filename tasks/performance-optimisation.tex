  The creation of reproducible software environments can take -- depending on
  the complexity and overall size of the destination environment -- quite some time.
  Often, an image can be built within few minutes,
  but there are environments that can take much longer.

  In this task, we will profile and optimise \repotodocker{} performance,
  both in terms of build time
  and image size (can be several gigabytes),
  which contributes to user-experienced performance as launching a large image
  can take longer than a small one
  when the image must be transferred across a network.
