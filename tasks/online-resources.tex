  \TOWRITE{repurposed from BOSSEE: target repo2docker docs for covering best practices}
  The aim of this task is to provide communities with online resources for Open Science and support \taskref{education}{workshops}.
  This task includes the following activities:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item Collaboration with the \href{https://coderefinery.org}{CodeRefinery} project for the development and maintainance of the \href{https://coderefinery.org/lessons/}{online lesson materials} on open science best practices (JupyterLab, version control, collaboration and peer review, documentation, testing, software licensing, and reproducible research).
    Following CodeRefinery's tradition, the aim will be to contribute the
    lessons to \href{https://software-carpentry.org/}{Software Carpentry}
    and \href{https://data-carpentry.org/}{Data Carpentry}.
\item Development of an interactive book on applied stochastic
  processes in Physics (\localdelivref{sde-book}). Unlike classical
  books in this subject, it will be supplemented by interactive
  numerical examples solving real life problems. This will be the
  occasion to emphasize the role of high performance computing in
  solving problems modeled by stochastic differential equations (SDE).
  The book will be available via the EOSC hub, and showcase the use of
  HPC hardware (GPU).
