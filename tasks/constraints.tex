% template for a task
% each task should be added to exactly one workpackage
% in the workpackage task list
\begin{task}[
  title=Reducing technical constraints for broader usage,
  % task id for references
  id=constraints,
  % lead institution ID
  lead=SRL,
  PM=1,
  wphases={0-36},
  % partner institution ID(s)
  % don't include lead here
  partners={MP}
]

In this task, we refactor and extend the existing code to be more flexible. In
particular, we want to address and remove the constraints that currently exist:

\begin{compactitem}
  \item Dependency of existing Kubernetes system
  \item Support of only Docker containers to host created software environments
     % deliverable will be defined in the appropriate WorkPackage.tex
    % (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
  \end{compactitem}

These steps are essential to enable the Binder@home and the Binder@HPC use
cases. \TODO{Add links to those tasks}.
  
%   The task includes the following activities
%   \begin{compactitem}
%   \item ...
%      % deliverable will be defined in the appropriate WorkPackage.tex
%     % (\localdelivref{deliv-id})
%   \end{compactitem}
\end{task}
