In this task, we want to use the compute power of the Desktops of individual researchers and
users, to recreate software environments in which computational results can be
reproduced, and re-used: We want to provide an experience identical or similar
to that of using BinderHub, but using only the local computer.

\paragraph*{Context:} Reproducibility services using Binder currently rely on hosted Binder instances.
The mybinder federation provides such a service global service at mybinder.org
which is free at
the point of use, and delegates the building of the software environment and
re-execution of the code to a small number of computer centres that have
volunteered to contribute compute resources.

It thus possible to overload the system \TODO{Add link to general discussion
  that mentions how many thousand builds take place per months etc}.

To allow the up-scaling of good reproducibility practice, it would be
desirable not to depend on such a single (or even multiple hosted services).

The compute resources offered through mybinder are modest: at most 2 GB of RAM
and a single CPU core (\TODO{check this!}).
Most laptops and Desktops have similar or much better hardware capabilities than
the mybinder cloud-computing resources currently offer

\paragraph*{Task activity:} Based on the preparations in \WPref{reproducibility} and
\WPref{impact}, extend Binder so that users of the service can
carry out the building of the environment, and -- if desired -- launching of a
notebook server \emph{on their own hardware}. The working title for such
functionality is ``binder@home'' (as a reference to the crowd-based SETI@home search for
extraterrestrial intelligence at home.\footnote{https://setiathome.berkeley.edu}

We will design, implement, and test the 'binder@home' functionality, and make it
available as part of binder software. We will need a utility that takes on
the responsibility of BinderHub for a single-user use case, and which triggers
the local build of the software environment, start of Jupyter notebook
server and opening of the relevant local URL and port an a browser.
