\paragraph*{Context:} Reproducibility services using Binder currently rely on hosted Binder instances.
The mybinder federation provides such a service global service at mybinder.org
which is free at
the point of use, and delegates the building of the software environment and
re-execution of the code to a small number of computer centres that have
volunteered to contribute compute resources.

It thus possible to overload the system \TODO{Add link to general discussion
  that mentions how many thousand builds tak place per months etc}.

To allow the up-scaling of good reproducibility practice, it would be
desirable not to depend on such a single (or even multiple hosted services).
  
The compute resources offered through mybinder are modest: at most 2 GB of RAM
and a single CPU core (\TODO{check this!, possible link:
\url{https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/about.html)}}).
Most laptops and Desktops have similar or much better hardware capabilities than
the mybinder cloud-computing resources currently offer
  
\paragraph*{Task activity:} Based on the preparations in \WPref{reproducibility} and
\WPref{impact}, extend Binder so that users of the service can
carry out the building of the environment, and -- if desired -- launching of a
notebook server \emph{on their own hardware}. The working title for such
functionality is ``binder@home'' (as a reference to the crowd-based SETI@home search for
extraterrestrial intelligence at home https://setiathome.berkeley.edu)
  
We will design, implement, and test the 'binder@home' functionality, and make it
available as part of binder software.
