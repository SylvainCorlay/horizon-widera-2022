The societal goals of Open Science - particularly improved validation and reuse of research outputs -
can only be achieved if reproducibility is an integral part of the process.
Merely available code is of drastically less value than code
that can be run easily by anyone.
As institutions and policies increasingly adopt Open and Reproducible policies,
researchers urgently need practical tools to fulfill these requirements.
Further, policy makers can benefit from tools for evaluation and enforcement of reproducibility policies.
In SOURCE, we focus on computational reproducibility.

To reproduce computational results, the software environment in
which to execute the code must be created.
This project automates and improves ways to do this by developing and extending the
Binder project.

Binder aims to automate existing practices
for reproducible computational environments,
solving a key piece of reproducibility without dictating the execution workflow itself.
Binder is a subproject of Jupyter,
providing open source tools such as the widely used Jupyter notebook.

Binder has demonstrated potential in the Jupyter community by serving over ten million user sessions in 2021 at mybinder.org,
building over fifty thousand unique computational environments.
We aim to bring this potential to researchers not yet served by the tools,
by extending the robustness and the applicability of the
Binder tools,
and delivering clear communication and training about best practices for reproducibility.

We motivate and validate our efforts with selected use cases, such as
data publishing and in High Performance Computing (HPC) contexts where Binder tools are not currently practical,
and engage with the global community of researchers to contribute to the open source project.
