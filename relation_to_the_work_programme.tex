\subsection{Relation to the Work Programme}

The \TheProject project addresses the challenges of the ``Prototyping
new innovative services'' call (ID: INFRAEOSC-02-2019).

Our strategy is based on taking the increasingly popular Jupyter
Notebook and Jupyter Ecosystem: we want to evolve and improve them
so that new innovative services based of the Jupyter tools can be developed for
the EOSC.
\medskip

There is evidence that the Jupyter Notebook is an e-infrastructure
that is useful across many domains: it is already widely adopted in
numerous communities and used by millions of researchers and educators worldwide
\cite{jupyter-grant}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Journalists} and practitioners of \emph{data-driven
    journalism} at the LA Times, BuzzFeed News, Columbia Journalism School \cite{latimes-datadesk} \cite{columbia-nytimes} \cite{data-journalism},
\item \emph{Research institutions} such as CERN, JRC, and many more,
  operating institution-wide Jupyter deployment,
\item \emph{Universities} using Jupyter as a teaching platform,
\item \emph{Large cloud providers} building commercial products on the
  top of Jupyter (Google DataLab and Colaboratory, Amazon Sagemaker, Microsoft Azure
  Notebooks),
\item \emph{Other EOSC projects}. Jupyter is already planned to become
  an important service on the European Open Science Cloud (for example
  the EOSC-04-funded PaNOSC project \cite{panosc}).
\item \emph{Data scientists}: some argue that the Jupyter Notebook is
  \emph{the} tool of choice for data scientists across domains
  \cite{Perkel2018}.
\item Over 3 million notebooks are deposited on GitHub \cite{notebookcount}.
\end{itemize}

    Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP) is a heavy user of the
    Jupyter Notebook (source:
    \url{https://cidportal.jrc.ec.europa.eu/home/}), where it features
    at the top of the pyramid to help users with interactive data
    visualisation and analysis. \emph{Right}: An example
    service in which an interactive visualisation is provided through

A particular example is the Joint Research Centre Earth Observation
Data and Processing Platform (JEODPP) shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jeodpp},
illustrating the interactive data exploration within an environment
that allows to save and communicate the data exploration
conveniently. These projects are building upon Jupyter as it is
available at the moment.
\bigskip

Within this context of a common software platform, we address the call
for prototyping innovative services:
\begin{itemize}
\item Our \TheProject proposal is focussed on developing the next generation
of the Jupyter tools to enable all domains to develop such services on
the EOSC.

\item Through the \TheProject-improved Jupyter, we will provide an
  agile and fit-for-purpose \emph{EOSC-enabled
framework} within which innovative services can be built by the
scientific communities.

\item We believe this is realistic as a multitude of (non-EOSC) services and
  use cases based on Jupyter have been developed, as sketched above.

\item We co-design the framework and the service demonstrators with
  core Jupyter developers, EGI and domain specialists from the
  scientific communities.

\item We will provide some particular services as part of the project
  (in the domains of geosciences, health,  education, and photon
  science) to stimulate the design of other novel innovative services
  to address the evolving needs of the scientific community.
\end{itemize}
