Ifremer, French National Institute for Ocean Science, is a
French public scientific and technological institution that works for
exploring, understanding and predicting the ocean.
A pioneer in ocean science, IFREMER’s cutting-edge research is
grounded in sustainable development and open science.
Ifremer's vision is to advance science, expertise and innovation to:
1) Protect and restore the ocean
2) Sustainably use marine resources to benefit society
3) Create and share ocean data, information & knowledge.
With more than 1,500 personnel spread along the French coastline
in more than 20 sites, the institute explores the 3 great oceans:
the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific oceans. A leader in ocean science,
IFREMER is managing the French Oceanographic Fleet and its dedicated
scientists create ground-breaking technology to push the boundaries
of ocean exploration and knowledge, from the abyss to the atmosphere-ocean interface.

Well-established in the international scientific community, IFREMER's scientists,
engineers and technicians are committed to advance knowledge about our planet’s
last unexplored frontiers. They provide the science we need for informed
decision-making and public policy and they transfer this knowledge and technology
to businesses to fulfill public and private needs. IFREMER's core mission is also to
strengthen public awareness about the importance of understanding the ocean and
its resources, and empowering future generations of leaders through education
and outreach national campaigns.

Founded in 1984, IFREMER is a French public organization and its budget
approximates 240 million euros. It is operating under the joint authority of
the French Ministry for Higher Education, Research and Innovation,
the French Ministry for the Ecological and Solidary Transition, and the
French Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

We will hire one research engineers to carry out the work
at Ifremer, under the leadership of and together with Dr. Odaka.  The
fellow will have a background in geoscience, combined with Xarray
and Jupyter Notebook experience, and past experience of software engineering.
An ideal candidate will also have good communication skills and team working
abilities, and in particular interest and skill in the development and
operation of software services to best support this part of the project.
