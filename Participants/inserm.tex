Inserm, the French National Institute of Health \& Medical Research is the only
public sector research institution in France exclusively dedicated to human
health. Under the dual aegis of the Ministries of Health and Research, Inserm
has a budget of 900 M euros and employs 15,000 scientists, engineers and
technicians all with one shared objective, namely to promote health - by
advancing knowledge about living organisms and their diseases, developing
innovative treatment modalities and conducting research on public health.

Inserm is represented within the \TheProject consortium through the Cancer Research
Centre of Toulouse (CRCT) and Inserm’s Computing Department (D\'epartement du
Système D’Information, DSI).

CRCT gathers academic, scientific, medical, clinical, technological and
pharmaceutical research on cancer on a 220-hectares site next to Toulouse,
France. Its missions are to improve fundamental knowledge on all aspects of
cancer biology and to provide patients with rapid access to innovative and
individualized treatments. On these premises, CRCT comprises 21 teams
affiliated to Inserm, the University of Toulouse and the CNRS (National Centre
for Scientific Research). Team 15 of CRCT led by M. Bardi\`es aggregates
Medical Physics resources available in Toulouse around a common research theme:
the optimization of radiotherapy through the development of innovative
dosimetric approaches at various scales (cell, tissue, patient).

Inserm's IT department (DSI) defines and coordinates IT and information systems
aspects across the whole institution. It designs and operates Inserm's
information system to support research activities of the institute, and
provides counselling and support to research units on information technologies.
It also plays a strong role in coordinating IT security and risk management
policies for the French health science community.

\subsubsection*{Relevant projects or activities}
Inserm is the leading academic biomedical research institution in Europe with
more than 13,000 publications a year; and second in the world (behind the
American National Institutes of Health).

Inserm has 24 international cooperation agreements, 33 associated European
laboratories (AELs) and associated international laboratories (AILs), and 183
Horizon 2020 contracts since 2014 - of which 45 were signed in 2017. 67 ERC
winners have been hosted at Inserm since 2012, 13 of whom in 2017.  Inserm is
involved in many ESFRIs:
\begin{compactenum}
\item ERINHA2 (H2020)
\item ERINHA (FP7)
\item ADOPT BBMRI-ERIC (H2020)
\item BioMedBridges (FP7)
\item MRTdosimetry EMPIR (H2020)
