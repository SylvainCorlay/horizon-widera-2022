work plan is broken down into
six work packages:
\WPref{core} about maintaining the core Jupyter software infrastructure,
\WPref{ecosystem} for developing the ecosystem of software surrounding Jupyter,
\WPref{applications} for building applications to demonstrate the efficacy and guide the development
of core infrastructure,
\WPref{eosc} for operating services built on these
components and collaborating with existing EOSC stakeholders,
\WPref{education} for educating the public on Open Science best practices with the project's tools
and fostering diversity in the research and software communities.
This is complemented by
the usual management  work package
(\WPref{management}).
